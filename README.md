This repo provides a tool and classes for packaging Sugar instances. We may extend these in the future with helpers for packaging Sugar modules, language packs, and themes.

# Packaging Instances
The following sections outline how to work with packaging a Sugar instance.

## Supported Databases
* MySQL

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/sugarcrm/Sugar-Instance-Packager
cd Sugar-Instance-Packager
composer install --no-dev
```

If composer is not already installed, you can install it by following the instructions here: https://getcomposer.org/download/

## Packaging a Sugar instance

To create a package from the command line, you can use `packager.php`. Usage is as follows
```
./packager.php [options] [<sugar-path>]
<sugar-path> is required
```

### Command Options
| Option  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| -h, --help | Print this help message and exit. |
| -v, --version | Print version information and exit. |
| --name [\<package name>] | File name of the package to be created. Defaults to "\<UNIX timestamp>.zip". |
| --destination [\<directory>] |  Directory to write the package to. Defaults to the current directory. |
| --type [\<package type>] | Type of package to create. Valid types are "MySQL" or "Cloud". Defaults to "Cloud". |

## Testing

Requires PHPUnit.
```
